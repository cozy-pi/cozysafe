# UI

One design, light and dark only (see `requirements.md`, Theming). Brand colours:
vault green `#165B4C` (deep `#0F3D33`, night `#0B2B24`), gold index `#F3D08E` /
`#D9A53F`, neutrals from the app theme (`app/lib/theme.dart`).

The brand mark is the combination dial reduced to three shapes: one thick ring,
a solid knob, the gold index (`branding/icon.svg`). Use it at every size; no tick
marks or extra detail.

## Unlock screen (chosen 2026-10-19: "B2")

- Background: a collage of protected items (photos, ID card, receipt, PDF,
  notes) tilted about −8°, **always blurred** so nothing is readable, under a
  vault-green veil: deep green at the top fading to pale mint (light) or to
  night green (dark).
- The collage is a **fixed illustration bundled with the app**, never thumbnails
  of the user's data: the screen runs while every vault is locked. Ship it as a
  pre-blurred image, not a live blur.
- No motion on this screen. Floating/appearing items were tried and dropped as
  too playful for a vault.
- Centre: a frosted card with the brand mark on its top edge, the title
  "Unlock", the password field, the Unlock button, then "Create a new vault".
  No subtitle and no item counts.
- Biometric unlock is **its own button** under Unlock (outlined), never an icon
  inside the password field: "Unlock with Face ID" or "Unlock with fingerprint"
  depending on the device; hidden when the device has no biometrics or the user
  has not enabled it.
- Light: white card, green Unlock button. Dark: green-black card, gold Unlock
  button, gold accents.

## Inside a vault

Mockup v2 covers the vault home (quick add: camera, photos, files, note;
recent items with thumbnails; photo and document grid; bottom navigation and a
+ button), the add sheet, note editor, file viewer, in-app camera, settings,
Emergency Kit, and a three-column desktop layout, each in light and dark.
