# UI

One design, light and dark only (see `requirements.md`, Theming). Brand colours:
vault green `#165B4C` (deep `#0F3D33`, night `#0B2B24`), gold index `#F3D08E` /
`#D9A53F`, neutrals from the app theme (`app/lib/theme.dart`).

The brand mark is the combination dial reduced to three shapes: one thick ring,
a solid knob, the gold index (`branding/icon.svg`). Use it at every size; no tick
marks or extra detail.

## Unlock screen (chosen 2026-10-19: "B2")

- Background: a collage of protected items (photos, ID card, receipt, PDF,
  notes) tilted about −8°, **always blurred** so nothing is readable, under a
  vault-green veil: deep green at the top fading to pale mint (light) or to
  night green (dark).
- The collage is a **fixed illustration bundled with the app**, never thumbnails
  of the user's data: the screen runs while every vault is locked. Ship it as a
  pre-blurred image, not a live blur.
- No motion on this screen. Floating/appearing items were tried and dropped as
  too playful for a vault.
- The one exception is the moment it opens (approved 2026-10-19): a vault-green
  overlay, the brand dial large in the centre turns half a turn (overshoots to
  ~192°, settles at 180°) and scales out to reveal the vault, about 1.1 s.
  With reduced motion: fade only.
- Centre: a frosted card with the brand mark on its top edge and the title, no
  subtitle and no item counts.
- Unlock order (approved 2026-10-19, mockup
  (internal mockup)): biometrics are asked for
  as soon as the screen shows; then the **PIN pad** if this device has a PIN
  (dots = PIN length, digits only, no letters, checks itself on the last digit,
  shakes on a wrong PIN, 5 wrong turns the PIN off); then the **password** (type
  to unlock, no Enter needed). "Use password" / "Use PIN" switch between them;
  "Create a new vault" sits under the password.
- The **add dock** (below) fills the bottom, identical to the one inside a
  vault. Left slot: a closed lock (state, not a button). Right slot: Face ID or
  fingerprint. Picking an add action while locked unlocks first, then runs it.
- Light: white card, green accents. Dark: green-black card, gold accents.
- Closing plays the opening moment backwards: the dial comes in from large,
  turns back half a turn, and the lock screen appears.
  (Previously: biometrics as an outlined button under Unlock; moved into the
  dock with the PIN pad.)

## Inside a vault

Mockup: (internal mockup) (v3, learned from
Apple Photos iOS 26, Google Photos, Files, Proton Drive, Ente Photos).

- Title (vault name) and a menu (PIN, biometrics, back up, Emergency Kit).
- **Library | Collections.** Library: everything by date (Today, Yesterday,
  This week, then months). Collections: Photos, Documents, Notes, Recently
  deleted, and the user's folders.
- Photos **edge to edge**, 2 px gaps, no corner radius; pinch to fit 3 or 5 per
  row. Documents and notes as a **list** (name, kind, date), never cropped tiles.
- Viewer: swipe sideways through photos, swipe down to close, tap to hide the
  bars; actions at the bottom.
- Delete goes to Recently deleted for 30 days (v0.1 stage 4).

### Add strip (approved 2026-10-19)

Mockup: (internal mockup)

- The bottom of the vault screen is a dark green dock, like the iPhone Camera
  mode dial: a horizontal strip of modes (Note · Library · Take photo · Scan ·
  File · Paste) that the thumb drags or taps; the selected mode is gold.
- One big round action button under the strip, always in the same place; its
  icon follows the mode. In Take photo it becomes a white shutter.
- The last-used mode is remembered per device and selected on the next open.
- Round slots beside the button. Inside a vault: Lock (left), Search (right);
  the lock is here, not top right, because the top corner is the hardest place
  to reach with one hand. On the lock screen: closed lock, biometrics.
- **One component** (`app/lib/widgets/add_dock.dart`) for both screens, same
  colour (#0A2A23), height, button size (72 px), so they cannot drift apart.
- Everything you add with lives in the bottom third of the screen (one hand).

Mockup v2 covers the vault home (quick add: camera, photos, files, note;
recent items with thumbnails; photo and document grid; bottom navigation and a
+ button), the add sheet, note editor, file viewer, in-app camera, settings,
Emergency Kit, and a three-column desktop layout, each in light and dark.

### Folders (decided 2026-10-19)

- Nested folders, like Files or a desktop: a folder holds items and folders,
  and every item lives in exactly one place. Move by drag and drop or "Move to".
- Importing a whole folder from the computer keeps its structure.
- The Library tab still shows every photo by date regardless of folder;
  Collections shows types (Photos, Documents, Notes, Recently deleted) and
  the user's folders.
- Folder names are encrypted like everything else (never plain file names on disk).
